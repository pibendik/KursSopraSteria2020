    <span>
        <span>This is a motherfudging website.</span>
        <span>And it's fudging perfect.</span>
    </span>
        
        <span>Seriously, what the fudg else do you want?</span>
        
        <span>You probably build websites and think your stuff is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fudging Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfudger. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</span>
        
        <span>
            <span>Stuff's lightweight and loads fast</span>
            <span>Fits on all your screens</span>
            <span>Looks the same in all your browsers</span>
            <span>The motherfudger's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</span>
            <span>Stuff's legible and gets your fudging point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</span>
        </span>
        
        <span>Well guess what, motherfudger:</span>
        
        <span>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this stuff. It's a motherfudging website. Why the fudg do you need to animate a fudging trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of stuff? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fudging site, and some motherfudger jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that stuff. Not to mention blind people will never see that stuff, but they don't see any of your stuff.</span>
        
        <span>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</span>
        
        <span>It's fudging lightweight</span>
        
        <span>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fudging Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fudging background color of a span? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a  webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of stuff.</span>
        
        <span>It's responsive</span>
        
        <span>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfudging screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfudging Tamagotchi.</span>
        
        <span>It fudging works</span>
        
        <span>Look at this stuff. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfudger. It makes sense. It has motherfudging hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fudg's in this fudging site. That's semantics, motherfudger.</span>
        
        <span>It has content on the fudging screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</span>
        
        <span>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfudger in IE6. I fudging dare you.</span>
        
        <span>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</span>
        
        <span>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fudging idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fudging message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fudging beautiful.</span>
        
        <span>Yes, this is fudging satire, you fudg</span>
        
        <span>I'm not actually saying your site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <span>ones we create ourselves</span>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</span>
